Translate a phrase from English to a number of different languages using the MyMemory translation api which takes user-submitted data to determine the closest translation match. The dictionary portion uses WordsApi and provides multiple definitions and synonyms (also user-submitted) with associated definitions for your word of choice. It was my first project learning about web development. My role was api consumption, wiring and event handling, and overall functionality.",

When they submit their artwork they have the option of including their Facebook and LinkedIn as means of contact. Users can also search a variety of mediums and by state. My role consisted of database/schema, wiring front-end, handlebars integration, and some styling touch-ups to give it more responsiveness and a cohesive appearance. This project was built with handlebars, uses a Cloudinary widget for image uploads, and MySQL for the database.",

We experienced a number of setbacks during our concept phase of our final project and threw this together. Preview songs with the spotify api, record notes or write down songs you discover with MongoDb, and enjoy a blast from the past with this retro themed amalgamation. My role involved React integration, API development and consumption, fixing Firebase auth persistence, and user experience. It may not be the prettiest, or most intuitive, but it was a lot of fun to build.",
